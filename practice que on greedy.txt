Question:
"Given a set of activities with start and end times, select the maximum number of activities that can be performed by a single person." please tell me in a easy way


Algo:
Sort the activities by their ending times.

Start with the first activity (the one that ends the earliest).

Pick it, and then skip any activities that overlap with it.

Move to the next activity that doesn't overlap, pick it, and repeat this process until you've checked all the activities.


Answer:
Example:
You have the following activities with their start and end times:

Activity 1: Starts at 1, Ends at 4

Activity 2: Starts at 3, Ends at 5

Activity 3: Starts at 0, Ends at 6

Activity 4: Starts at 5, Ends at 7

Activity 5: Starts at 8, Ends at 9

Activity 6: Starts at 5, Ends at 9

Steps to Solve:
Sort activities by their ending times: After sorting by end time:

Activity 1: Ends at 4

Activity 2: Ends at 5

Activity 3: Ends at 6

Activity 4: Ends at 7

Activity 5: Ends at 9

Activity 6: Ends at 9

Start picking activities:

Pick Activity 1 (ends at 4).

Now, skip all activities that overlap with Activity 1. Activity 2 and Activity 3 overlap, so ignore them.

Move to Activity 4 (starts at 5, doesn’t overlap with Activity 1). Pick Activity 4.

Next, pick Activity 5 (starts at 8, doesn’t overlap with Activity 4).

Activity 6 overlaps with Activity 5, so skip it.

Result:
The maximum number of activities you can choose is 3:

Activity 1 (1 to 4)

Activity 4 (5 to 7)

Activity 5 (8 to 9)

We have 4 jobs to schedule on a single machine. Each job has a processing time and a due date:

Job	Processing Time (hours)	Due Date (hours from now)
A	4	7
B	3	5
C	2	6
D	1	8
Step 1: Sort Jobs by Due Date
We rearrange the jobs in ascending order of their due dates:

Job B (due in 5 hours)

Job C (due in 6 hours)

Job A (due in 7 hours)

Job D (due in 8 hours)

Step 2: Schedule Jobs in Order
We process the jobs one at a time in this sorted order:

Job B: Starts at time 0, ends at time 3

Job C: Starts at time 3, ends at time 5

Job A: Starts at time 5, ends at time 9

Job D: Starts at time 9, ends at time 10

Step 3: Calculate Lateness for Each Job
Lateness is calculated as: Lateness = Completion Time - Due Date (if this value is negative, lateness is 0).

Job	Completion Time	Due Date	
B	3	5	0
C	5	6	0
A	9	7	2
D	10	8	2
Result:
Using the EDD rule, the maximum lateness is 2 hours, and we minimized it by scheduling jobs based on their due dates.

Let me know if you'd like to explore variations or more complex scenarios!

what is lateness
Lateness refers to how much a job's completion time exceeds its due date. Mathematically, it's defined as:

Lateness = Completion Time - Due Date

If the lateness value is positive, it means the job finished late.

If it's zero, the job finished exactly on time.

If the value is negative, lateness is considered zero, as it indicates the job finished early.
